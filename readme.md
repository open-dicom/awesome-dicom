> A curated list of awesome DICOM resources and libraries.

The [DICOM Standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/) is _the_ international standard for medical images and related information. It defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use <sup>[[source](https://www.dicomstandard.org/about-home)]</sup>.
